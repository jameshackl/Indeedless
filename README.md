# Indeedless
I found it tiring to have to filter through the hundreds of posts everyday. This chrome extension adds the option to hide posts. Hidden posts are persistent on the same computer. 

## Installation

Download or clone the repository.

If you downloaded the repository, extract it to a directory.

Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) 

Enable 'Developer Mode'.

Select 'Load unpacked extension...'

Navigate to repo folder then select 'Ok' to install the extension.

(To update, sync repo folder then select 'Reload' in the extensions manager)

## Usage

After the extension is installed two buttons will be added to the job postings on Indeed: Hide Post, and Clear List.

Hide Post will hide the post immediately and for anysubsequent visits.

Clear List will clear the hidden posts list. All of the posts selected to be hidden will now appear again. You will need to refresh the page to see the changes.

## TODO

- move 'Clear List' button to settings or options.
- make an 'Undo' button.
- provide additional information about posts in the clearing and restoring options.
- cross domain storage. filtering is applied on a per domain basis.
